## Cognitive/Motor Profile (Nov 2025 Neuropsych)

### Deficits
| Area | Percentile | Impact |
|------|------------|--------|
| Fine Motor | 3rd | Can't write legibly for extended periods |
| Visual-Motor Integration | 5th | Copying from board is exhausting |
| Processing Speed | 12th | Needs extended time on everything |
| Working Memory | 18th | Multi-step directions challenging |

### Strengths
| Area | Percentile | Impact |
|------|------------|--------|
| Verbal Reasoning | 72nd | Can express ideas well verbally |
| Basic Reading | 45th | Reading comprehension preserved |
| Vocabulary | 68th | Strong language skills |

### Key Insight
Maya is cognitively capable but physically limited. The gap between her verbal abilities (72nd percentile) and her motor/processing abilities (3rd-18th percentile) creates significant frustration. She knows the answers but struggles to produce written work.

## IEP History

### Current Services (Inadequate)
- OT: 30 min/month consult only (should be 60 min/week direct)
- Extended time: 1.5x (recently won in December amendment)
- Preferential seating: Front, near door
- Rest break: 1 per day (insufficient)

### What We're Fighting For
1. **Direct OT services** - 60 min/week minimum
2. **Comprehensive AT** - Laptop + Livescribe + keyboarding software
3. **Modified schedule** - Leave at 1pm due to fatigue
4. **Updated health plan** - New nurse needs training

---

## Key Relationships

### Allies
- **Dr. Sarah Williams (Private OT)** - Wrote strong evaluation supporting 60 min/week
- **Dr. James Park (Oncologist)** - Will write letters supporting accommodations
- **Mrs. Linda Torres (7th grade English)** - Understands Maya's needs, supportive

### Neutral/Unknown
- **Dr. Patricia Nguyen (Case Manager)** - Professional, follows process
- **New school nurse** - Unknown, needs to meet

### Challenging
- **District OT (Ms. Karen Davis)** - Defensive about service levels
- **Mr. Steven Brown (Asst. Principal)** - Focuses on "least restrictive environment" arguments

## Important Dates to Remember

- **Aug 2024** - BMT at Children's Hospital
- **Jan 2025** - Returned to school (5 months post-transplant)

---

## Advocacy Lessons Learned

1. **Always request in writing** - Verbal denials are hard to appeal
2. **Private evaluations carry weight** - Dr. Williams' OT eval was crucial
3. **Document fatigue patterns** - Home logs support schedule modification
4. **Celebrate small wins** - The extended time victory took 3 meetings but mattered

## Parent Preferences

- Michael handles most school communications
- Jennifer manages medical appointments
- Both attend IEP meetings together
- Prefer email over phone (creates paper trail)
- Want collaborative relationship with school but will escalate if needed
