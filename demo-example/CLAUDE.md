## How This Toolkit Works

**Drop documents in the inbox. That's it.**

The toolkit automatically:
- Sorts documents into the right folders
- Extracts key dates, scores, and deadlines
- Updates your timeline and calendar
- Identifies what's missing or needs follow-up

No manual file management. No folder decisions. Just drop and go.
