# Current Status - Maya Chen IEP Advocacy

*Last updated: January 19, 2026*

---

## Overview

Maya's advocacy involves four concurrent threads, each at a different stage. This complexity is typical for medically fragile students with significant support needs.

**Overall Phase:** Active advocacy with state complaint pending; preparing for annual review.

## Thread 1: OT Services Dispute

### Status: STATE COMPLAINT FILED - Awaiting Response

**The Issue:**
- School provides: 30 minutes/month consultation only
- Private OT recommends: 60 minutes/week direct service
- Gap: School's service level is 1/8th of what Maya needs

**Timeline:**
| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Nov 15, 2025 | Private OT evaluation completed (Dr. Williams) |
| Nov 20, 2025 | Shared evaluation with school |
| Dec 3, 2025 | Requested IEE for OT at IEP meeting |
| Dec 10, 2025 | School denied IEE request (letter received) |
| Jan 6, 2026 | **State complaint filed** |
| Jan 8, 2026 | Acknowledgment letter received |
| **Jan 27, 2026** | **District response due (8 days)** |
| ~Feb 27, 2026 | State decision expected (60 days from filing) |

**Key Evidence:**
- Private OT evaluation documenting 3rd percentile fine motor
- Classroom work samples showing deteriorating handwriting across day
- Comparison of Maya's output vs. grade-level expectations

**What to Expect:**
- District will submit written response by Jan 27
- State investigator will review both sides
- May request additional documentation
- Decision typically within 60 days of complaint

**Action Needed:** Monitor for district response; be prepared to submit rebuttal if needed.

## Thread 2: Assistive Technology

### Status: MEETING SCHEDULED - Prep Needed

**The Issue:**
- AT evaluation completed December 2025
- School recommended: iPad with speech-to-text only
- Parents want: Laptop + Livescribe pen + keyboarding software
- School's recommendation doesn't address full range of Maya's needs

**AT Meeting: January 24, 2026 (5 days)**

**Our Position:**
1. **Laptop over iPad:**
   - Better keyboard for developing typing skills
   - Full word processing capabilities
   - School's other students use laptops
   - Long-term skill building for high school/college

2. **Livescribe Pen:**
   - Records audio synced with written notes
   - Reduces pressure to write everything
   - Maya can focus on key words, review audio later
   - Addresses working memory deficits

3. **Keyboarding Software:**
   - Maya needs explicit instruction
   - Current typing speed: ~8 WPM
   - Goal: 25+ WPM by end of year
   - Compensates for handwriting limitations

**Evidence to Bring:**
- Neuropsych showing 3rd percentile fine motor, 18th working memory
- Handwriting samples showing fatigue deterioration
- Research on AT for students with motor impairments
- List of specific software recommendations

**Action Needed:** Prepare talking points and evidence packet before Jan 24.

## Thread 3: Fatigue Accommodations

### Status: NEEDS ATTENTION - Not Yet Formally Requested

**The Issue:**
- Maya is consistently exhausted by 5th period (12:30pm)
- Current IEP allows only one rest break per day
- Rest break helps but doesn't solve the problem
- Academic performance drops significantly in afternoon classes

**What We Want:**
- Modified schedule: Maya attends school 8am-1pm
- Afternoon instruction provided via:
  - Recorded lessons
  - 1:1 check-ins with teachers
  - Homebound services for core academics

**School's Likely Objection:**
- "Least restrictive environment" (LRE) concerns
- Will argue Maya should be with peers all day
- May suggest she "push through" fatigue

**Our Counter-Arguments:**
1. LRE doesn't mean "most time in building"
2. Maya in pain/exhausted ≠ meaningful participation
3. Neuropsych documents processing speed deficits
4. Oncologist can provide medical documentation
5. Other transplant patients routinely have modified schedules

**Evidence Needed:**
- [ ] Fatigue log showing daily patterns (Jennifer is tracking)
- [ ] Letter from Dr. Park (oncologist) supporting modified schedule
- [ ] Grade comparison: morning classes vs. afternoon classes
- [ ] Research on post-BMT fatigue in pediatric patients

**Action Needed:** Formally request modified schedule in writing; gather supporting documentation.

## Thread 4: Health Plan Update

### Status: NEEDS SCHEDULING

**The Issue:**
- School nurse Mrs. Thompson retired December 2025
- New nurse is unfamiliar with Fanconi Anemia
- FA has specific medical protocols that staff must understand
- Flu season increases infection risk for immunocompromised student

**What Needs to Happen:**
1. Identify new school nurse (contact info unknown)
2. Schedule health plan review meeting
3. Provide FA education materials
4. Update emergency protocols
5. Train relevant staff (PE teacher, cafeteria, etc.)

**FA-Specific Training Topics:**
- Immunocompromised status and infection precautions
- Signs of GVHD flare requiring immediate action
- Fatigue management and rest break protocols
- No live vaccines in classroom setting
- Emergency contact hierarchy (parents → oncologist)

**Action Needed:** Contact school to identify new nurse; schedule meeting ASAP.

## Recent Win: Extended Time Amendment

### December 2025 - SUCCESS

**What We Achieved:**
- Extended time (1.5x) now applies to ALL assignments, not just tests
- Previously, Maya had extended time only for formal assessments
- Daily homework and classwork were causing stress and incomplete work

**How We Won:**
- Meeting 1 (Oct): Raised concern, school said "not necessary"
- Meeting 2 (Nov): Brought work samples, school said "let's monitor"
- Meeting 3 (Dec): Brought neuropsych data + 6 weeks of incomplete work log
- School agreed to amendment

**Lesson Learned:** Persistence + documentation = results.
