# What-If Guides

Guidance for specific situations.

## Topics

Create guides for situations like:
- What if they deny my request for services?
- What if I disagree with the evaluation?
- What if they want to reduce services?
- What if my child isn't making progress?
- What if I need an outside evaluation?
- What if I need to escalate?
- What if I need an advocate or attorney?

## Format

Each topic has:
- `topic-quick.md` - One-page quick reference
- `topic-detailed.md` - Full guide with examples
