## In a Meeting Right Now?

### You Can ALWAYS:
- Ask for clarification
- Request time to think
- Take a break
- Bring up concerns
- Disagree respectfully
- NOT sign anything on the spot

### Magic Phrases:
- "I need time to review this at home."
- "Can you explain the data supporting this decision?"
- "I'd like that in writing, please."
- "I'm requesting Prior Written Notice."
- "Let's schedule a follow-up meeting."

## They Just Said Something Concerning?

### If they say: "We don't do that here"
**You say:** "Can you show me where in policy that's stated? IDEA requires decisions based on individual student needs."

### If they say: "We don't have the resources"
**You say:** "I understand budgets are tight, but IDEA requires services based on need, not availability."

### If they deny your request:
**You say:** "I'm requesting Prior Written Notice explaining this decision and the data it's based on."
