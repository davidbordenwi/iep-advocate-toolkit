## Current Phase: Active Multi-Thread Advocacy

**Primary Focus:** Managing multiple concurrent advocacy issues while preparing for annual IEP review.

### Active Threads
1. **OT Services Dispute** - State complaint filed, awaiting response
2. **AT Implementation** - Meeting Jan 24
3. **Fatigue Accommodations** - Need modified schedule
4. **Health Plan Update** - New nurse needs training

---

## Urgent Deadlines

| Date | Item | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| **Jan 24, 2026** | AT implementation meeting | 5 days - PREP NEEDED |
| **Jan 27, 2026** | State complaint response due | 8 days - MONITOR |
| **Feb 20, 2026** | Annual IEP review | 32 days - START PREP |
| TBD | Health plan update meeting | NEED TO SCHEDULE |

---

## Recent Win

**December 2025 Amendment Meeting:** Secured extended time (1.5x) for ALL assignments, not just tests. This took 3 meetings to achieve but is a meaningful accommodation for Maya's processing speed and fatigue challenges.

## Information Gaps

These items would strengthen your advocacy:

- [ ] **New school nurse contact information** - Mrs. Thompson retired; who replaced her?
- [ ] **Written rationale for OT denial** - Request this in writing for complaint record
- [ ] **Full AT evaluation report** - You only received the summary
