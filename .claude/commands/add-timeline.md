# Add Timeline Entry

Add an event to the advocacy timeline log.

## Instructions

1. **Ask for event details** (if not provided):
   - Date of event
   - Type of event (meeting, phone call, email, decision, etc.)
   - Brief description
   - Key people involved
   - Outcome or next steps

2. **Format the entry** for timeline/advocacy-log.md:
   ```markdown
   ## [Date] - [Event Type]

   **Description:** [What happened]

   **People involved:** [Names and roles]

   **Outcome:** [Result or decision]

   **Next steps:** [Action items]

   **Documentation:** [Reference any saved documents]
   ```

3. **Add to timeline/advocacy-log.md** in chronological order (newest at top)

4. **Cross-reference** if relevant:
   - Update CURRENT-STATUS.md if status changed
   - Update calendar/deadlines.md if new deadlines
   - Log correspondence if communication involved
   - **Update MEMORY.md Session Notes if:**
     - New form/document status learned
     - Process clarification discovered
     - Correction to existing information
     - Important context for future sessions
   - If event is a significant milestone (win, decision, major change):
     - Consider adding to MEMORY.md "Key Wins" or "Lessons Learned" if applicable
